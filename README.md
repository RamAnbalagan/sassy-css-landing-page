 ### Sass Variables
   Although we can use variables in regular CSS , we can also choose to use SASS. Because the generic CSS variables might be only supported in certain browsers, wheras SASS ensures this is supported everywhere ( since it translates it to regualr CSS)

 * Sass Maps
 * Nesting
 * Mixins
 * Functions
 * Sass & Media Queries

# Notes

* Two ways to use SASS in a project 
   - Go the package.json (npm init )+ webpack route
   - Use visual studio sass compiler ( use an extension as a hack to live pre-compile SASS)

* SASS is compiled into CSS.
* In our SASS File we could use SASS , but also regular CSS.
* use www.caniuse.com to compare features of different browsers.
